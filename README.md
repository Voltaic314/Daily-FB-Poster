This code was created by Logan Maupin aka Voltaic314 on GitHub. I am a student at the University of Arizona. I had this idea for this page and code idea from the page on FB called "Daily Updates on the Status of Michael Jackson's Health Condition", which is a much larger page than mine. It posts irregularly and I wanted to make a page that would post consistently. (But some would say that kind of spoils the humor of it). 

If you are wondering how my code knows when to post, it's because it's running off a raspberry pi that I have, using cron jobs to determine when to execute the script. The Pi just runs 24/7. My Pi is also hosting other scripts I'm running so it's worth it. This is a pretty lightweight script to run. :) 

As always, any suggestions to make the code better or more efficient is always welcome. Thanks for reading and I hope you guys enjoy it.
